## Introduction
* This repository provides implementations of Ex-DPC, Approx-DPC, and S-Approx-DPC.
* They are fast algorithms for [density-peaks clustering](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6191/1492.full) (proposed in Science).
* As for the details about these algorithms, please read our SIGMOD2021 paper, [Fast Density-Peaks Clustering: Multicore-based Parallelization Approach](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448016.3452781) or [arXiv one](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04649.pdf) that corrects our theoretical analyses.
* __[New] A faster algorithm is available [here](https://github.com/amgt-d1/Ex-DPC-plus-plus) and dynamic cluster update is available [here](https://github.com/amgt-d1/D-DPC).__
	*  I recommend this new version.

## Requirement
*  [spatial library](http://spatial.sourceforge.net/)
	* We used version 2.1.8.
* Boost 1.67.0
	* We have not confirmed the availability of the other versions.
* The source codes of DPC algorithms have to be changed based on your paths of the above libraries.

## How to use
* We assume low-dimensional datasets, as we use a kd-tree.
* Implementation is based on https://github.com/gishi523/kd-tree and spatial library.

### Linux (Ubuntu)
* Ex-DPC
	* Compile: `g++ -O3 main.cpp -o exdpc.out -fopenmp` and run: `./exdpc.out`.
* Approx-DPC
	* Compile: `g++ -O3 main.cpp -o approxdpc.out -fopenmp` and run: `./approxdpc.out`.
* S-Approx-DPC
	* Compile: `g++ -O3 main.cpp -o sapproxdpc.out -fopenmp` and run: `./sapproxdpc.out`.

### Datasets
* As an example, we have prepared a 2-dimensional synthetic dataset used in our paper.
* If you want to test your dataset,
	* Put the file at `dataset` directory.
	* Assign a unique dataset ID.
	* Set the dimensionality at `data.hpp`.
	* Write codes for inputing the data file in `input_data()` function of `file_io.hpp`.  
	* Add a directory in `result` and update the function `compute_direcotry()`.
	* Compile the code and run .out file.

### Parameters
* Set some value in the corresponding txt file in `parameter`.
* For \rho_min and \delta_min, we specify them in `file_io.hpp`.

### Approximation algorithms
* If you want to compute RI (rand index), ARI, or NMI,
	* get cluster labels from Ex-DPC, and
	* consult [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.adjusted_rand_score.html).
